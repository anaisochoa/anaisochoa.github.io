    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>This is all by trial and error and I will be describing what I do on my wash days. I do my full wash day once a week and exclusivly use silicone, paraben, and sulfate free hair products. I have 2b hair so this is not for everyone!</p>

          <h4>First Step:</h4>
          <h5>Shower Time!</h5>
          <p>The very first thing I do is take a shower. But even showering requires some steps in between! So, I do a pre wash using my NYM charcoal scalp scrub which helps get rid of the itchiness and dandruff that I get throughout the week. I massage it into my scalp for about 1 minute and rinse off with my NYM Tahitian Gardenia Flower shampoo and conditionar. I leave the conditionar in my hair for about 5 minutes while I do other things like shave and wash the rest of my body and I'll finally rinse.</p>

        <div class="second">
          <h4>Second Step:</h4>
          <h5>Deep Conditioning!</h5>
          <p>Using a deep conditionar once a week is so so so important. The one that I am currently using is Shea Moisture Manuka Honey Intensive Hydration Masque. I use this one because my hair is dry at the ends and I found that this keeps it super hydrated. I take a generous amount and spread it on my hair while finger combing. I'll then put my hair on top of my head to sit and wrap a plastic hair cap to trap in the heat. I will then use my deep conditioning hair cap which I microwave for 90 seconds and keep it on for about 30 minutes.</p>

        <div class="third">
          <h4>Third Step:</h4>
          <h5>Rinse and Style!</h5>
          <p>Now that my hair has been cooking for 30 minutes, I like to rinse it all off in the shower. My hair feels so soft and moisturized after; I love it! After I rinse, I use my NYM curl defining cream and finger comb/ scrunch and use that same technique with my NYM curl defining gel. After those products are combined with my hair, I air dry and I'll be ready for the days to come!</p>
